'==========================================================
' Gatekeeper protocol
'==========================================================
'
' -------
' Purpose
' -------
'
' The Gatekeeper protocol is design to be a standard for
' interfacing game clients and game servers for non
' performance-critical communictions, such as chatting,
' user account validation, and server administration.
'
' Some capabilities include:
'
' * Enabling game clients to log into game servers, with such
'   features as user account tracking and password validation.
'   The advantage of Gatekeeper over custom solutions is that
'   only one set of user accounts need be maintained for all
'   supported games.
'
' * Enabling game clients to obtain level and player lists
'   from servers, so that utilities like QSpy may support
'   a wide range of Internet based games without knowing
'   the nitty gritty details of each game.
'
' * Enabling server administration clients to log into
'   servers, allowing remote administration of servers
'   across the net.  The becomes useful in complex games
'   like MUDs where remote dungeon masters maintain user
'   accounts.
'
' ------------
' Design goals
' ------------
'
' *. We clearly favor ease of client implementation over
'    ease of server implementation, as the number of different
'    client implementations is expected to far exceed the number
'    of server implemntations.
'
' *. Because Gatekeeper packets will be competing for bandwidth
'    with time-critical gameplay packets, an essential design
'    goal is to minimize the size of Gatekeeper server responses.
'    Minimizing the size of client commands is not as significant,
'    since game communications tend not to require much client-to-
'    server bandwidth.
'
' *. Though the protocol definition must be synchronous (except for
'    the async notify codes), clients which don't require absolute
'    reliability should be implementable asynchronously, sending
'    commands and ignoring the replies, looking only for specific
'    response data types.
'
' *. All aspects of the protocol should be designed for
'    future extendability.
'
' -----------
' Typical use
' -----------
'
' A typical game server will make its Gatekeeper TCP port
' publically available, and use it for administration, sending
' player lists and stats, and for chat.  This enables
' all Gatekeeper-compatible utilities to work will all
' Gatekeeper-compatible servers.  For performance reasons,
' these game servers will typically use a separate port,
' usually a proprietary game-specific protocol, to
' coordinate all in-game action.  GameKeeper knows
' nothing about these in-game protocol details.
'
' Originally designed for games based on the Unreal engine,
' the Gatekeeper interface is simple, standard, and
' extensible enough that it could easily be used for most
' other Internet-based games.
'
' The protocol is text-based and it enables easy
' communication in both numeric machine-recognizable
' and human-readable format.  When a Gatekeeper server is
' initially connected to, all responses are sent in both
' formats. The "Verbose" command turns on machine-only
' format, and "Client" turns back to human and machine format.
'
' The Gatekeeper protocol takes place across a simple TCP
' connection and thus it may be manually used by telneting
' into a Gatekeeper server on the appropriate port.
'
' ------------------------------------
' Client commands and server responses
' ------------------------------------
'
' Clients send commands as ASCII text strings, terminated
' by a cr/lf pair.
'
' Servers send responses as ASCII text strings, where the
' first three characters of every line are a numerical
' response code, so that automated clients may recognize
' the responses easily.  The first 3 characters are
' always numeric and are listed above in the GK_ definitions.
' After the first three characters, a server response may
' be terminated with a cr/lf pair, or it may be followed by
' a space and a line of response-specific text, and terminated
' by a cr/lf pair.
'
' -----------------
' Data format rules
' -----------------
'
' Character set rules:
' *. Gatekeeper servers should terminate all lines of text they
'    send with a cr/lf pair to facilitate Telnet use.
' *. Gatekeeper clients only need terminate lines with cr's.
' *. Gatekeeper clients and servers should recognize lines that
'    are only cr terminated (no lf required).
' *. Servers should send only ASCII 10, 13, and 32-126
'    during normal use, and 8 only when echoing back client input.
' *. Automated clients should send only ASCII 13, and 32-126.
' *. Recognizing that clients may be human and may be hackers,
'    the server must handle (gracefully) anything that clients
'    throw at it.
' *. Here we are only defining a rigid input standard for
'    automated clients sending command lines which contain
'    regular ASCII characters and cr/lf's.  The functionality
'    of additional control codes as well as VT-100 style escape
'    sequences is implementation-defined, and implementations
'    may choose to implement a VT-100 telnet-friendly input
'    system.
'
' Parameter rules:
' *. Parameters (items which are sent from either the client or
'    server to the other party) may be either an unquoted string
'    consisting of the regular ASCII characters with no spaces,
'    or a quoted string containing any ascii characters 32-126.
' *. A quoted string need not have an ending quote.
' *. In quoted strings, \ followed by a character means that
'    the next ASCII character from 32-126 is literal. This is
'    how you can stick quotes in quoted strings.
' *. Any parameter that contains spaces, quotes, or \'s must be
'    sent as a quoted string.
'
' Name rules:
' *. Wherever a name is required, a parameter is fetched and it
'    is checked to verify that it's a valid name. Thus, it is
'    valid to quote a name.
' *. A name must start with a-z or A-Z, and may only contain
'    the characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ".", and "_". Names must be
'    between 1 and 31 characters. Servers must not accept or
'    perpetuate any bad names.
' *. For comparison purposes, names are not case sensitive.
'
' Number rules:
' *. Wherever a number is required, a parameter is fetched and it
'    is checked to verify that it's a valid number. Thus it's
'    valid to quote a number.
' *. Number must begin with an optional leading + or -,
'    followed by a digit, followed by multiple digits with
'    one optional decimal point.  Numbers are signed and
'    must contain at least 32 bits of precision.
'
' --------------
' Protocol rules
' --------------
'
' Once a TCP connection is established, the communication
' session goes as follows:
'
' 1. Server sends GK_Notify_Version, GK_Notify_Maker,
'    and GK_Notify_Time. Then optionally sends any other
'    GK_Notify_PrintMe messages that the client should display.
'    Clients who are telnetting in see all of these codes.
'    Automated clients should display all of the
'    GK_Notify_PrintMe codes sent by the server, as these
'    may contain important information (hours, rules, etc).
'
' 2. Client sends a text command line.
'
' 3. Server processes the command line.
'
'    If the command is not valid or generates an error, the server
'    replies with GK_Failure.
'
'    If the command is successful, the server will send zero or
'    more GK_Notify or GK_DbNotify responses answering the
'    client's query, followed by one GK_Success response.
'
' 4. If we're still connected, go back to step 2.
'
' Thus, each client command ultimately generates one and only one of the
' following responses: GK_Failure, GK_Success, or a disconnect.
'
' ----------------------
' Asynchronous responses
' ----------------------
'
' At any time, the server may decide to send an asynchronous
' GK_Notify or GK_DbNotify message to the client.  These
' notifications are for events like chat text arriving, or a new
' level becoming available. The client should receive these and
' process them (or choose not to process them) as it wishes.
'
' At any time, the server may disconnect the client by sending
' GK_Notify_EndSession. However, the client may not receive these as TCP
' often breaks the connection before all queued up data has been sent,
' so clients should always gracefully handler servers disconnecting.
'
' GK_Notify codes are for notifying the client of asynchronous
' events that are not database-oriented, such as chat text arriving.
' The text following the GK_Notify code, if any, is code
' specific.
'
' GK_DbNotify codes are for notifying the client of asynchronous
' events that are database oriented, such as changes, additions,
' and deletions to the player list. The text following the
' GK_DbNotify code is record oriented, in the following
' format:
'
'   GK_DbNotify <+/-> <keyfieldvalue_name> [<field_name>=<value_parm>]...
'
'   Where:
'     + means that keyfieldvalue_name represents a new keyfield that was
'       not in the database prior to the notify, or a modified
'       pre-existing keyfield.
'     - means that keyfieldvalue_name was in the database prior to
'       the notify and is now being deleted; in this case
'       no record information follows.
'     keyfieldvalue_name is the value of the record's key field,
'       such as player name (in the player list) or level name
'       (in the level list).
'     The zero or more optional field_name/value_parm pairs
'       indicate values in the database. Any fields that are
'       not sent are assumed to be empty strings or zero numbers
'       on the client side.
'
' If implemented soundly, a client should be able to
' subscribe to a database (such as a player list or level list),
' immediately receive the current information, and then receive
' async notifications for all additions, deletions, and changes
' so that the client's database is always synchronized with
' the server's minus some time lag.
'
' ---------------
' Gatekeeper time
' ---------------
'
' Each Gatekeeper keeps its own internal time (in seconds)
' which is sent to clients using GK_Notify_Time and can
' be requested via the Time command. The time has a
' completely arbitrary starting point, but counts up at
' exactly one unit per second. Level launch times are tracked
' in Gatekeeper time, so that clients can tell how long a
' level has been up by taking the difference between
' the current Gatekeeper time and the level up-time.
'
' ----------------------
' Protocol extensibility
' ----------------------
'
' The protocol may be extended in the future by adding
' new numeric codes to the above codes.  When a client
' receives a code of the form XYY and his version of
' the protocol doesn't recognize XYY, he must treat it
' exactly as the generic response, X00.  If he doesn't
' recognize X00, he ignores the code entirely.
'
' For this reason, all of the X00 codes, such as GK_Notify
' don't do anything special, and thus future server responses
' have no effect on current clients.
'
' Servers should be designed so that new codes don't
' break old client versions, in accordance with the
' above scheme.
'
' -----------------------------
' Notes on command descriptions
' -----------------------------
'
'   [thing] means that the enclosed thing is optional.
'
'   <something> means that you replace <something> with an
'   actual parameter.
'
'   <something_name> refers to a name. See the name rules above.
'
'   <something_parm> refers to any kind of parameter, usually a string.
'   See the string rules above.
'
'   <something_num> refers to a number. See the number rules above.
'
'   <parm1 | parm2> means that either parm1 or parm2 can be used
'   but not both.
'
'   ... means that the previous item may be repeated zero
'   or more times.
'
'   Extraneous parameters following a command (i.e. more parameters)
'   than the server expects) are ignored, so that all commands may
'   be expanded in the future by adding more parameters.
'
' --------------------
' Gatekeeper datatypes
' --------------------
'
' The following single character codes indicate datatypes:
'
' N: A name, 1-31 characters, must start with a letter and contain
'    only letters, numbers, and "_".
' O: An optional name; may be a name or may be blank.
' P: A password, may either be a name or a blank (zero-length) string.
' I: A 32-bit integer.
' B: A boolean value, either 0 or 1.
' F: A floating point number.
' S: An ASCII string containing only ASCII 32-126.
'
' -------------------
' Gatekeeper commands
' -------------------
'
' Verbose
'    [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'    Instructs the Gatekeeper server to send verbose
'    responses, with both numeric and human-readable text.
'    Verbose is on by default. The opposite of Verbose is Client.
'    When in verbose mode, commands are echoed back to facilitate
'    telnet usage.
'
' Client <protocol_version_num> [<application_name> [<application_version_num>]]
'    [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'    Instructs the Gatekeeper server to send machine readable
'    responses only (opposite of Verbose) and adhere to
'    a protocol version of ProtocolVersion or earlier.
'
'    ApplicationName and ApplicationVersion are optional
'    single-word strings identifying the client application
'    and its version, for informational purposes only. The
'    server should not adjust its behaviour according to the
'    client application name or application version.
'
'    When in client mode, commands are not echoed back.
'    Version numbers are integers in the form NNNFF
'    where NNN=integer and FF=decimal. For example,
'    version number 1350 means "13.50".
'
' Login <user_name> [<password_name>]
'    [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'    Attempts to log in with a specified name.  If that
'    name has no password associated with it, the password is
'    ignored.  When you connect and you first log in,
'    you have Info privelages, which let you get the
'    player lists and level lists, iff the server
'    has a blank Info password. Passwords are not case
'    sensitive. Upon success, sends the player's name.
'
'    The following names are special:
'    Admin<#>: The server administrator. When you log in
'       as Admin, a number will be appended to your name so
'       that your name is unique even if other administrators
'       are online.
'    Not-logged-in: Assiged to users who have not yet logged in.
'
' Exit
'    [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'    Logs you out.  Note that it's fine for clients to just disconnect
'    without using the Exit command.
'
' Save <db_name>[;<db_name>]... <localfilename_parm>
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Save's the specified databases into a local file.
'     Requires Admin privelages.
'
' Exec <localfilename_parm>
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Executes the commands from the specified file
'     as if they were typed from the console.
'     The response codes resulting from the command execution
'     will be sent, followed by GK_Notify_ExecComplete.
'     The client can count on always receiving a
'     GK_Notify_ExecComplete after all of the Exec result
'     codes, so that it may maintain synchronization.
'
' Rem <remark text up to ending cr/lf>
'     [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'     A remark command; has no effect at all.
'
' Notify <user_name> <notifycode_num> [<msg_string>]
'     [Access: Admin or level privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Sends the specified notification code (and optional)
'     string to the user. The code must be in the range
'     from GK_Notify to GK_Notify_Max.
'
' Echo <echo text up to ending cr/lf>
'     [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'     Echoes text to the client on the server's
'     GK_Success response line.
'
' Time
'     [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'     Sends the current Gatekeeper time in seconds,
'     using GK_Notify_Time.  Each Gatekeeper keeps its
'     own time with an arbitrary (meaningless) starting
'     point, which counts up at exactly 1 unit per second.
'
' LevelFiles
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Returns a list of filenames for levels which are in
'     the Gatekeeper's level directories but are not
'     on the level list.
'
' AddLevel
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Adds a specified level file to the Gatekeeper's level list.
'
' DeleteLevel
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Deletes a specified level file to the Gatekeeper's level list.
'
' UpLevel <level_name>
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Attempts to launch the level's level server to bring
'     the level up.
'
' DownLevel <level_name>
'     [Access: Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Attempts to shut the level down.
'
' Play/Watch <level_name> <level_password>
'     [Access: LoggedIn privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Attempts to enter the specified level for either
'     playing or watching. The player must not already
'     be in a level when he uses this command, and the
'     password must match (if the level has a password).
'
' BeginLevel <levelport_num> <app_string> <appversion_num>
'     [Access: Level privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     This command, usable only by a level server, tells
'     the Gatekeeper that the level server's level is up.
'
' Kick <user_name> <msg_string>
'     [Access: Level or Admin privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Kicks a player out of the level server's level.
'     If you specify a properties string, that string
'     represents the player's private persistent properties
'     at the time he exits the level. The format is
'     completely up to the level server; the Gatekeeper
'     makes no attempt to figure out its meaning.
'
' UserExtra <user_name> <info_string>
'     [Access: Level privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Updates the user's public game-specific information.
'     This information is made available to everyone with
'     Info privelages and is used for stuff like kill
'     counts, score, etc.  This command should be used
'     judiciously, as it often results in a stream of
'     notifications sent out over the network - it makes
'     sense to only update the UserInfo when major events
'     happen (like a user dying).
'
' LevelExtra <extra_string>
'     [Access: Level privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Set's the level's "extra" string, a publicly readable
'     string which level servers may use for any internal
'     info they wish to make available publically.
'
' LevelExec <commands>
'     [Access: InLevel privelages required, Version: 0.10]
'     Valid only when the client is in a level, this passes
'     the specified commands to the level server via
'     GK_Notify_LevelExec for execution. This command always
'     succeeds when you're in a level; any data that the
'     level server wants to return must come via async
'     notifications.

' ------------------------------------------
' Gatekeeper 0.10 database oriented commands
' ------------------------------------------
'
' Gatekeeper defines a simple interface for single-keyed, flat,
' record-oriented databases such as the player list and level list.
' The interface enables clients to obtain a database's current
' records, and then be notified of all changes that occur.
'
' Here, <db_context> means a database name, optionally followed
' by a colon and a semicolon-delimited list of fields to get.
' For example:
'
'     "Levels" requests the all values of all records of Levels
'         database.
'
'     "Users:Users;Team;Level" requests all of the User, Team, and
'         Level values from the Users database.
'
' Get <db_context> [key_name=value_parm] ...
'     [Access: Requires read access for the specified database, Version: 0.10]
'     Gets all of the records in the specified database, using the
'     GK_DbNotify code, and then sends a success code.  Sends
'     a failure code if any problems occur.  This does not subscribe
'     the client to the database, so no future updates are changed
'     and a nonzero GK_DbNotify channel is not assigned.  This is
'     used for getting a database once where you need no updates.
'     This fails if you have insufficient access to the database.
'
'     If you specify one or more optional search limiters (matching
'     keys/values), then only the records matching all of the
'     limiters are returned.
'
' Sub <db_context> [key_name=value_parm] ...
'     [Access: Requires read access for the specified database, Version: 0.10]
'     Tries to subscribe the client to the named database.
'     If the client doesn't have read access, fails.
'     If successful, first sends a GK_Success_DbSubscribed message
'     with a unique nonzero GK_DbNotify code attached, for example
'     textually, "101 501". This enables the client to subscribe
'     to multiple databases and easily distinguish between GK_DbNotify
'     codes by number. Immediately after the success code is sent,
'     the server sends a dump of all of the database's current records.
'     As the database is updated, the server sends notify messages
'     of added, modified, or deleted records.
'
'     If you specify one or more optional search limiters (matching
'     keys/values), then only the records matching all of the
'     limiters are returned.
'
'     Note that the GK_DbNotify mechanism limits clients to
'     subscribing to 199 databases at a time.
'
'     Note that it's valid for a client to subscribe to a database
'     multiple times, possibly with a different search limiter for
'     each subscription. Each subscription will be assigned a unique
'     GK_DbNotify code.
'
' Unsub <db_notify_code_num>
'     [Access: All, Version: 0.10]
'     Unsubscribe from the database, for example "Unsub 501".
'
' Set <db_name> [<key_name>=<value_parm>]...
'     [Access: Requires write access for the specified database, Version: 0.10]
'     Sets the contents of the specified database record or adds a new
'     record.  If the database is multi-record, one of the keys specified
'     must be the database's keyfield.
'
' The limit on the number of client-subscribed databases is 199,
' based on the number of GK_DbNotify codes available.
'
' Obviously the client is responsible for remembering the
' associations between all of his subscriptions and the
' corresponding GK_DbNotify codes returned by Sub.
'
' There is a special database named "Databases" which is
' simply a list of all of the databases available on the system.
' You get Get and Sub it just like any other database.
'
' Note that there is no way to create a new database or to restructure
' an existing one. The goal of Gatekeeper databases isn't to provide
' an interesting database engine, but to make it easy to reliably
' replicate internal server databases on the client side.
'
' -------------
' Level servers
' -------------
'
' The typical level server is launched as follows:
'
' 1. The level server is either automatically launched
'    at Gatekeeper startup time, or is launched manually
'    by a Gatekeeper admin by using the command
'    "Level Up <level_name>".
'
' 2. The Gatekeeper runs the level server's executable,
'    which it deduces from the file extension of the
'    level name. For example, the ".unr" file extension
'    is registered to Unreal, so launching "Level.unr"
'    automatically spawns Unreal. The Gatekeeper spawns
'    the level server with whatever command line
'    paramteres were specified for it in the level's
'    properties.
'
' 3. Once the level server has initialized itself, it
'    establishes a TCP connection with the Gatekeeper
'    and logs on, typically using the following
'    commands:
'        Client <gk_version_num> <app_name> <app_version>
'        Login <level_name> <level_password>
'        Sub Levels Level=<level_name>
'        Sub Users Level=<level_name>
'        BeginLevel <levelport_num> <app_name> <app_version>
'
'    The first subscription command subscribes the
'    level server to the level list, so that it can
'    get incoming Gatekeeper requests (via RequestState).
'
'    The second subscription command subscribes to the
'    list of players who are in the level server's level.
'    This is how the level server recognizes that the
'    Gatekeeper has allowed new players to enter, or forced
'    existing players to leave. For consistency, the level
'    server should take the Gatekeeper's player lists as
'    absolute truth. If the level server wishes to kick
'    a player out, it should issue a "Level Kick" command
'    to the Gatekeeper.
'
'    The "BeginLevel" command tells that Gatekeeper that
'    the level is up and running, and ready to accept
'    players. It also notifies the Gatekeeper of the
'    level's port which may be either TCP or UDP and which
'    may use whatever protocol the level server desires;
'    the Gatekeeper only uses this port to notify accepted
'    players where they can find the level server.
'
' 4. The level server manages the game in progress,
'    recognizing players as they enter, and continuing
'    until the level server decides to exit, or the
'    Gatekeeper requests it to go down.  During gameplay,
'    the level server uses the "Level UserInfo" command
'    to update publically viewable player stats.
'
' 5. When the level server is ready to go down, it should
'    simply exit. If any players remain in the level, the
'    Gatekeeper handles notifying them that the level is
'    down.

'
' Gatekeeper: A machine on the Internet which controls access
' to a game-specific game server and chatting among players
' worldwide.  Clients make requests to join game levels to the
' Gatekeeper, and the Gatekeeper performs
' high-level player and connection management.
'
' Gatekeeper protocol: A synchronous, text-based protocol built
' on top of TCP which provides a reliable way for clients and
' Gatekeepers to communicate. The protocol is designed to be
' reliably machine-readable, and also human-readable via Telnet.
'
' Gatekeeper client: Any player, utility, or administrator who
' is connected to a Gatekeeper.  A Gatekeeper client may become
' a player by successfully joining a game.
'
' Player: A single game participant.  There are two sides to
' a player, the side that exists on a client machine (where
' the graphics are drawn and the input is taken), and the
' side that exists on a level controlled by a game server,
' where all physics and gameplay decisions are made.  At any
' time, a player will be in either 0 or 1 levels.
'
' Game server: A machine on the Internet which may control one
' or more levels.
'
' Level: An object controlled by a game server which contains players
' in a gaming context.
'
' Master server:
'
' A machine on the Internet that controls high-level player
' accounts, persistent player statistics, and manages
' worldwide chatting.
'
' -----
' Notes
' -----
'
' *. Though we make specific reference to TCP here, the Gatekeeper
'    protocol is equally usable with any other reliable stream
'    based protocol.
